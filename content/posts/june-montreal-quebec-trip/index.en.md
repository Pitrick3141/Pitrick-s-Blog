## 0 Introduction:mag:

I used to plan to go to **Ottawa**, **Montréal** and **Québec** with my friends during our spring break in March. However, we have to *postpone the plan indefinitely* due to COVID.

On a random day at the beginning of June, my friends and I talked about our plan for summer. We found that none of us are returning to our country and therefore we came up with the plan of traveling. At first, we planned to travel in **Alberta**. But our spare time doesn't fit and we finally agreed to make a short-term trip in **Québec**. Having determined the time, we made a quick arrangement of Montréal and Québec city. We have made the scheme quickly on the basis of the previous research in March. We have booked all tickets and stays within a week to leave more time for arrangement and dealing with accidents.

## 1 Overview:school_satchel:

Our Trip will be taking place during **June 24 and June 28**. The last Exam day of 2021-2022 semester is June 23, which means June 24 is the *Beginning of Summer Vacation*:blush:. The trip doesn't include any flight. We will use [**VIA Rail**](https://www.viarail.ca/)[^1] to get to Montréal from Toronto and back to Toronto from Québec city. We will use [**Orléans Express**](https://www.orleansexpress.com/)[^2] from Montréal to Québec city. We hope that the trip will be a happy and fulfilled *Trip of Culture and Nature*, relieve us from the academy of last semester in the two historical cities of Montréal and Québec city.
