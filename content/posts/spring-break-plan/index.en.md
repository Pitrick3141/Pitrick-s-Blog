*Time files like an arrow* and it's another spring break. Due to the impact of pandemic, I could only travel to nearby cities during last spring break. Because the pandemic is slightly relieved this year and we are all fully vaccinated, I decide to make a short-term trip to a relatively far place with my friends. I will write down our plan outline here and update it during our trip. The plan was made by four of us in a couple of days. There may be some flaws and improper arrangements because it's our first time to schedule a trip by ourselves. There may be inevitable accidents during the trip so the schedule may be changed. The actual outcome shall prevail. The trip covers **Ottawa**, **Montréal** and **Québec**. It includes several cultural and natural projects. I hope that we can be edified by arts and cultures during the one-week-trip and relaxed thoroughly for the next period of study.

## Pre-trip preparation

### 2.28 Mon

I practiced swimming in a pool for the water activities during the trip. I haven't swum for a year and I feel quite rusty.

### 3.1 Tue

I updated my address on my licence to keep it updated with my current address. As my main id, the information on my licence should be accurate and up to date.

### 3.5 Sat

I bought a swimming suit and windbreaker in Yorkdale for the trip.

### 3.10 Thu

We are setting off in the morning of the day after tomorrow. One of us can't attend the trip due to a force majeure factor. I wish that she can experience the trip through this travel record.
