## 1 rebuiltCnt += 1

I have already forgotten how many times I’ve rebuilt my blog. Four? Five? I guess. I don’t know. However, I got to tell you about my tough journey since you visit here. My very first blog is hosted by [*Tencent Cloud*](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com). But due to the limitation of policy, I can’s bound it to my domain name so I have to give it up. I have tried a [business blog website builder]^([*GoDaddy*](https://godaddy.com)) and [*Github Pages*](https://pages.github.com), but they have their own flaws. The business blog website builder have limited degrees of freedom and can’t satisfy my need of build a website. If I want to increase the degrees of freedom it will exceed my budget. Though *Github Pages* can satisfy through customize needs, the visit speed is limited and unsatisfactory. It only supports static blog writing method (like [*Gridea*](https://gridea.dev)). The good point is that it is totally free. I used [*Freenom*](https://www.freenom.com) + [*Cloudflare*](https://www.cloudflare.com) to bound my website to my domain name and encrypt it with https with no cost.

## 2 My Current Plan

After my repeated consideration, I chose a compromised plan. I rented a server located in North America (provided by [*Virmach*](https://virmach.com)). Its configuration is **1G RAM + 25GB SSD, 1 Core CPU, 1.5TB Bandwidth with speed 1Gbps**. It satisfies my need for a public IP address and a fast visit speed. The biggest advantage is that it doesn’t need a record. The domain name mapping and https encryption is also conducted by the free plan of *Freenom* + *Cloudflare*. I have rented the server from *Virmach* for 3 months. I plan to continue hosting my blog here until I have my own server (probably a long time later). Everyone is welcome to visit my blog!
